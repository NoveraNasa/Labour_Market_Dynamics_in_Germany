# Labour_Market_Dynamics_in_Germany
Project under Research Software Engineering
labor market of Germany evolved over historically significant period. It includes reunification 
recovery, EU expansion, Global crisis of 2008, and CoVID-19 pandemic. 
This study will provide the opportunity to study the structure changes in the economy. The 
number of registered unemployed individuals, registered job vacancies implementing short-time 
work schemes. It enables comparison between eastern and western Germany and allows for long 
duration analysis which is more than 30 years.


Questions:
How job vacancies developed and unemployed number according to job changes from 
years?
Is there any CoVid-19 effect in different region?
Can we identify periods of economic stress or recovery based on short time work and 
unemployment figures?
How Labor Market is responsive to Macroeconomic shocks (e.g: 2008 and 2020)?


Variable of Interest
*	Year
*	Region
*	Registered Unemployment
*	Registered Vacancies
*	Short-Time Workers
*	Establishments with Short-Time Work



Analysis steps
1.	Data cleaning and Preparation
*	Standardize labels
*	Convert data types (e.g., data columns to datetime formats)
*	Missing or incomplete entries.

2.	 Descriptive Analysis
*	Compute annual averages and totals for each indicator.
*	Compare summary statistics across regions and key time periods.

3.	Time Series Analysis
*	Plot trends for unemployment and job vacancies over time.
*	Identify significant changes or turning points during historical events (e.g., 2008, 
2020).
4.	Regional Comparison
*	Assess disparities in labour market outcomes between Eastern and Western 
Germany.
*	Analyze recovery rates and policy impact post-reunification and during COVID-
19.
5.	Shock Analysis
*	Focus on two key periods: the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
*	Investigate whether these events led to significant short-time work spikes and 
unemployment increases.
6.	Visualization Plan
*	Line graphs for trends across time.
*	Bar charts for region-by-region comparisons.
*	Heatmaps or area plots for visualizing short time work intensity by year and 
region.


Tools and Libraries
The analysis will be conducted using Python, with the following libraries:
*	pandas for data manipulation
*	matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
*	plotly for interactive exploration
*	numpy for numerical computations
